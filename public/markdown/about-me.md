# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am a B.Tech student at the [Computer Science and Engineering(AI&ML)](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) department of [SRK Institute of Technology](https://srkit.in/).

I'm trying to find a balance between applied AI engineering and product innovation.

My current interests lie in building intelligent systems that combine machine learning, real-time data, and intuitive user experiences. Iâ€™m especially focused on practical applications of LLMs, fraud detection in blockchain ecosystems, and AI-powered food and legal tech.

I'm also learning full-stack development and actively building mobile and web-based platforms that merge AI research with real-world usability.
